HOW TO RUN:

		 - We have included the executable for all questions
		 - Compilation: gcc -o q<question number> q<question number>.c
		 - Execution: ./q<question number> > output.txt
		 - output.txt contains the output of the program

For question 2, output screenshot is included because the .txt file is vague.
